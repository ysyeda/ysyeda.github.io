#### Situation
Over the last couple of months, I worked as a software engineer at a social media company on a team that was working on restructuring the front-end architecture of the web-based product, along with building out parts of a new user interface. The process of rolling out these changes to users was to start by the end of 2015.

#### My Actions
Having joined the the team at an important juncture, one involving a rebuilding of the front-end architecture, I quickly caught up to speed, and agreed to take part in the **workload division** amongst the team, taking on the tasks that would contribute towards building this new architecture.

I took on the tasks that seemed a bit too challenging or ones whose implementation details I wasn’t too sure about. I took them on primarily because they would provide a greater learning opportunity for me, being outside of my comfort zone, and it would help the more senior developers of the team focus on the tasks that deserved their attention.

I **worked independently** on the implementation to meet the deadlines set by the team as a whole, according to the expectations of the organization. I was often involved in pair-programming with other developers, when the tasks involved figuring out a more complex set of details.

With regards to the software architecture, our team often held informal sessions dedicated to plan and figure out implementation details. During these sessions, I **engaged in the problem-solving** process: **articulated the problems** that I was tackling, proposed solutions, **actively listened** and sought for feedback and criticism from other team mates, and **asked questions** to establish a greater understanding of the existing architecture and the problem.

Throughout this process, I was involved in **building trust** by reiterating others’ concerns to make sure that the team moved forward with a unified understanding. I **advocated for my opinions** based on the knowledge of software design patterns, **gave feedback** to team mates on their ideas and implementations, and received the same for the work I had done, and then reiterated to take into account the feedback that was given.

Most of the tasks involved in the restructuring and rebuilding process were quite extensive. I contributed to the process of **breaking down these tasks** into more manageable chunks, and then **communicated** as these tasks were completed to allow the team to build upon what was completed, and announce internally, what details of the architecture were completely implemented.

#### Results & Conclusion
One of the key takeaways from working in a closely-knit team that was making decisions along the way was the importance of being able to whiteboard problems in order to think more deeply about their solutions, or the higher level architecture. I’d like to further develop the skills needed to visualize an overview, and the ability to dial down on the specific details, in order to communicate them to the team. I believe that skill is a useful one to have for someone focusing on engineering and design.
