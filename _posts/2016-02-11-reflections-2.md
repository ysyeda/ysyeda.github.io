### Situation
Over the last week, I used my **teamwork** skills to complete some of the essential coursework for a group project for the User Experience Design course that I’m taking this term. We were required to compile our findings after conducting several user interviews and reflect back on them to analyze what had worked well and what had not, and was due the following Tuesday. Being the busiest time of the term, with co-op interviews, midterms and assignments, the time that each member had to spend on the project, was limited.

### Action
My first action was to **reach out to the members** and let them know that I would be available online to meet on Monday, and that I would have some time over the weekend to get a head start. This allowed us to book a time slot for late Monday evening to complete all the work as a group.

The next course of action was uploading all the recordings of the interviews that I had recorded on my phone to enable the notetakers of the interviews could go over these recordings and ensure that that their notes covered all the details of the interviews.

After that, I **started working on the task** involving writing down the reflections of our group, based on our interviews. Since we had already had discussions between each interview and after finishing our interviews, I had a fairly good idea of how we felt. I wrote the first draft of the reflections. And on Monday evening, we met online, and continued working on the document. **I asked  each member of the group for feedback and criticism on the draft**.

One group member suggested that the question involving the use of technology had worked the best for us, while I had argued that the introductory questions worked really well. In our discussions, **I advocated for my suggestion** up until the point where my team mate was able to provide a better argument for their suggestion. At that point, I decided to **incorporate their suggestion** without further argument. I used this strategy for other parts of the report and used it to **rephrase, extend and direct the contributions and ideas of other group members**. This ensured that the **content we were putting in our group reflections was very well-reasoned**.

Over the course of our work, I **actively listened to all members** of the group and **made sure that each had an input**. If I felt that one of the group members hadn’t had the chance to put their thoughts forward for a particular topic area, I prompted them by saying something like “What are your thoughts on that, <group member name>”.

### Result
The result of the teamwork was that we were able to complete the work comfortably before the deadline. Moreover, our notes in conjunction with the recordings ensured that they reflected the conversation as it took place. We were satisfied with our reflections as it made us realize what we needed to improve for our next interview sessions.
