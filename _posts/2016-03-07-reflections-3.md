#### Situation
Over the past two weeks, I have been working on building the first prototype of an Instagram campaign for UWaterloo Arts and testing it with the users. This will help in making decisions about the final campaign that is to be published. Over the course of building this first prototype, I relied heavily on working **independently**. More specifically, I **exercised personal initiative and accountability**, **made decisions**, and **thought critically and creatively** to design the first prototype.

#### Action
The first thing I did was to **get started independently** to find the images that could make up our campaign’s static and dynamic visual content. The UWaterloo Arts Flickr page had some sharp photos of the Theatre & Performance program, the program that the campaign was being built for. I went to the Flickr account and I **listed out all the images** that we could use for our campaign, and then **evaluated and curated these based on aesthetic features** of the images in consideration with the type of content people liked based on our earlier findings.

At this point, I **communicated the progress and the challenges** I was facing with curating the images to my team, and **took their advice and feedback**  in order to proceed systematically with the curation process. Next, I made a new Instagram page for our prototype to live on, and uploaded the curated images with various filters. the purpose of trying this out was to familiarize myself with Instagram’s filters and the upload process, since that would help our group when we were putting up the final prototype.

After the images, I set out to **gather more information** that I would need to build the prototype. This included the types of hashtags that were commonly associated to the University of Waterloo, as well as its Faculty of Arts. Moreover, for the dynamic content, I wanted to figure out what it should link to. The two choices were linking the viewers to the ‘Faculty of Arts’ undergraduate page, or the ‘Find out more about Theatre and Performance’ undergraduate page. **After assessing both**, I decided on the latter since it was directly related to the program we were designing the campaign for and this page provides valuable information to students who have an interest in applying to this program.

#### Result
The results of spending this time on the process of carefully building the prototype became evident when we put it in front of our users as part of our user testing. Some notable details were how they were able to determine that the campaign was geared towards Theatre and Performance, just by looking at the thumbnails of the photos we had selected. Moreover, because the curation process included a variety of photos, we were able to see what types or styles of photos they preferred, and what styles they didn’t.

I was able to gain insights that will allow me to iterate on the prototype with my group and incorporate changes that are in line with our findings from the user tests. I think this situation demonstrates my ability to approach a problem **independently**, and **take an initiative** to understand and solve the problem effectively.
