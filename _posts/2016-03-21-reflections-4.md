#### Situation
Our group has been working on conducting two rounds of user tests for our Instagram Campaign over the past few weeks. We were asked to prepare a report after each round to highlight our findings from the tests. I was able to utilize my **communications skills** to achieve this task. More specifically, I **communicated vital information, and presented arguments and analyses in writing**. Moreover, I **presented the summary** of our findings and analysis from the first user test to the class **verbally**.

Before starting to write the report, the note takers of each interviews from our group put the notes in a template that would allow others  to parse that information more. We also shared the screen and audio recordings with each other.

#### Action
I started out by going over the notes and the recordings to ensure that the report I was about to write would have content that is accurate. After going through our notes of the user tests, I began writing the report. I **used precise, clear and appropriate language** based on the evidence collected from our user tests to **present arguments in a substantive style**. I added images in the report that captured some of the problems that were highlighted in the report, and used that as a basis to provide reasoning and present the solutions to these problems. In order to **make this content more memorable and engaging**, I used the recordings of our user test session as well as the post task questionnaire to include quotes from our respondents. The written report was drafted in a way so that it **adapted to different audiences**. This included the people which were a part of the course that would be reviewing the report and giving feedback, as well as stakeholders that were interested in the results and outcomes of our user tests. Both these groups would have something to gain from reading the report..

I also presented a summary of the first user test report verbally to the rest of the students taking the course. This involved showing them the prototype we had built to demonstrate the exact problems that our users faced when interacting with the prototype. I **anticipated the questions they would asked** based on the choices we had made for our prototyped and **answered them**. One such question included as to why we didnâ€™t include any text in our photos in the Instagram Campaign. I was able to explain that the decision was based on our earlier findings from our persona interviews. Lastly, I was **received some critical feedback and ideas** from the people who are a part of this course and was able to take that into consideration for the final prototype.

#### Result
The result of writing the reports was that it allowed me to think more analytically about the responses we had received as part of our user tests, and even present some of those ideas to the class and get their feedback on them. It allowed us to go back and reiterate on the prototype, and after writing the report for the second user tests, I was more confident about the set of suggestions we had for the stakeholders given our user tests.
