### Overview
This post highlights the work done to design and build the prototypes for the Instagram campaign, based on the persona created. This post also contains the reports from the user test sessions in which we gained valuable feedback from the users about the prototypes we had built.

### Prototype 1
Here is the first prototype of the Instagram campaign that we built.

#### Static Content
The prototype shows the Instagram account for the first prototype and some of the photos that we found that our users really liked.
<div class="video-container">
  <video class="video-iphone" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dac309/proto11.mp4" controls>
  </video>
</div>


#### Dynamic Content
We prototyped a 'carousel' of images using Instagram video. We added a link in the bio and prompted the users to navigate it through the bio.
<div class="video-container">
  <video class="video-iphone" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dac309/proto12.mp4" controls>
  </video>
</div>


### User Test 1 Report

#### Prototype 2
Here is the second prototype of the Instagram campaign that we built.


#### Static Content
The prototype shows the Instagram account for the second prototype, highlighting the photos that we post-processed to look brighter and happier, along with some of the new photos, and a couple of photos with text, which was something we experimented with.
<div class="video-container">
  <video class="video-iphone" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dac309/proto21.mp4" controls>
  </video>
</div>


#### Dynamic Content
We prototyped a 'carousel' of images using Instagram video. We added a link to the last image in the 'carousel', so that our users could better identify the hyperlink. Note that this form of content is better suited to be presented through Instagram's sponsored content.
<div class="video-container">
  <video class="video-iphone" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dac309/proto22.mp4" controls>
  </video>
</div>


### User Test 2 Report

### Final Presentation
Here is the final presentation presented to the stakeholders of the project. It summarizes the findings of our user tests from the reports, and presents recommendations to some of the problems we uncovered during the process of designing the user experience for the Instagram Campaign.
