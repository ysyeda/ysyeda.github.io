#### Situation
Recently, I’ve been working with a team to create an Instagram Campaign for the University of Waterloo Arts Faculty and its Theatre and Performance program. During the process of creating the campaign, we conducted user interviews, built a persona, built a prototype, and tested our prototypes with users. At the end of the process we were ready to present our findings to the stakeholders for the project. This allowed me to exercise my **teamwork** skills to help our team formulate the final presentation to the stakeholders. More specifically, I **exercised initiative, responsibility, and accountability** in the group, as well as **facilitated the group**, and **led problem solving** efforts.

#### Action
First, I went over the parts of the process we needed to present to our stakeholders so that they could understand how we had arrived at the solution being presented to them and the recommendations being made. Next I **negotiated groups tasks** with the other two members of the group and assigned them certain chunks of the presentation, that they were willing to take on. I agreed to the **workload division**, and then **independently worked** on the parts that were the most important – the sections of the presentation that focused on the results of user tests and the recommendations that we were giving.

One our individual tasks were completed, we met as a group to review the work. During this, I **facilitated the group** by articulating the direction we wanted to the take our presentation in, this allowed them to frame their arguments in a similar manner, thus making the contents of the presentation more cohesive and aligned. I **rephrased, extended and directed** the contributions from the other members of the team. During this process, I gave some **critical feedback** to the work that had been completed by my teammates, and similarly, **received criticism** from them, and adjusted my work accordingly.

Lastly, it was important the recommendations we were setting forth had the input of all the team members. There, I **led the problem solving efforts** by laying out all the things we had learnt and starting the discussion around what suggestions we wanted to set forth based on our findings. I provided them with a summary of the findings from the tests and well as helped the team recall our conversations with our users. This helped generate creative and innovative solutions to the problems we were attempting to solve.

#### Result
The result of exercising teamwork at this important juncture was that we were able to provide a top three list of recommendations to the stakeholders which was based on evidence that we had gathered. The teamwork skills I used allowed the team to direct their efforts towards a common goal and achieve that goal by presenting our work to the stakeholders.
