<div class="about">
  <p>Hello! I’m Moaaz Sidat, a designer & developer living in Waterloo, ON. I’m currently studying computer science at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank" class="link-text">University of Waterloo</a> with a heightened interest towards Human Computer Interaction.</p><br>

  <p>I currently work at <a class="link-text" href="http://freshbooks.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener>FreshBooks</a> as a software developer. I'm also helping build <a class="link-text" href="https://hackthenorth.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener>Hack the North</a> this year as a platform developer. My previous work includes software engineering at <a href="http://hootsuite.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener class="link-text">Hootsuite</a> and product design at <a href="http://mappedin.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener class="link-text">MappedIn</a>.</p><br>

  <p>I love obsessing over typographic details, enjoy talking and thinking about product design, front-end engineering & prototyping. I enjoy building products and crafting experiences surrounding them.</p><br>

  <p>I spend some of my time trying to learn something new. These days my focus lies mostly towards <a class="link-text" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel=noopener>machine learning</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank" rel=noopener class="link-text">React Native</a>. I’m a cat-lover and an occasional photographer. I enjoy hand-lettering & illustrations, and will sometimes explore those two worlds of design purely for fun.</p><br>

<!--<p>I’m currently looking for small scale front-end development or interface design projects.
