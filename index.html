<div class="about">
  <p>Hello! I’m Moaaz Sidat, a designer & developer living in Waterloo, ON. I’m currently studying computer science at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank" class="link-text">University of Waterloo</a> with a heightened interest towards Human Computer Interaction.</p><br>

  <p>I've most recently worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://hootsuite.com" target="_blank" class="link-text">Hootsuite</a> and previously as a Product Designer at <a href="http://mappedin.com" target="_blank" class="link-text">MappedIn</a>.</p><br>

  <p>I love obsessing over typographic details, enjoy talking and thinking about product design, front-end engineering & prototyping. I enjoy building products and crafting experiences surrounding them.</p><br>

  <p>I spend some of my time trying to learn something new. These days my focus lies mostly towards <a class="link-text" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/navigation/" target="_blank">OSX Development</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mtmograph/videos" target="_blank" class="link-text">Motion Design</a>. I’m a cat-lover and an occasional photographer. I enjoy hand-lettering & illustrations, and will sometimes explore those two worlds of design purely for fun.</p><br>
