<div class="about">
  <p>Hello! I’m Moaaz Sidat, a designer & developer living in Waterloo, Canada. I’m currently studying computer science at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank" class="link-text">University of Waterloo</a> with a focus towards human computer interaction.</p><br/>

  <p>I enjoy building products that solve meaningful problems for people through design and engineering. I’m passionate about product design, front-end engineering and prototyping.<p><br/>


  <p>I’m currently helping build <a class="link-text" href="https://hackthenorth.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener>Hack the North</a> – one of the world's largest hackathons, where over a thousand students experiment, meet people in tech, and solve problems. My previous work includes engineering at <a class="link-text" href="http://freshbooks.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener>FreshBooks</a> and <a href="http://hootsuite.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener class="link-text">Hootsuite</a>, and design at <a href="http://mappedin.com" target="_blank" rel=noopener class="link-text">MappedIn</a>.</p><br/>

  <p>I spend some of my time trying to learn something new. These days I’m learning more about <a class="link-text" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel=noopener>machine learning</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank" rel=noopener class="link-text">React Native</a>. I also enjoy <a href="https://instagram.com/moaazsidat" class="link-text" target="_blank" rel=noopener>photography</a>, and occasionally explore hand-lettering & illustrations.</p><br/>

<!--<p>I’m currently looking for small scale front-end development or interface design projects.
